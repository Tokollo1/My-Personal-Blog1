CS50 Final Project (Web Track)

This is a blogging website build using Django, HTML (with Bootstrap 4), CSS and some JavaScript and jQuery.
The functionality of this website are:
- Allow registered users to create a new blog post. Like/dislike blog post and leave comments.
- Allow users to customise their profile. Choose and crop their desired profile image. Toggle between Light and Dark Mode.
- Number of blog posts and comments per page are paginated to reduce clutter and improve loading time. 
- Blog Posts, comments, likes/dislikes and profile settings are saved to the database. 
- To save space in the server, old profile picture are deleted automatically when the users uploads a new profile picture.
- Authors of the blog post/comments are able to update/delete their post/comments if desired. 

Currently, the profile images are stored in AWS S3 Buckets and the website is deployed using Heroku.

Future Improvements for the project can be implemented on the CS50 Sidebar:
- Showing the latest post since we have tracked the date/time the post is created on the database.
- Showing trending post based on likes/dislike ratio of each post.
- Add some announcements if the website has some important updates (such as T&C) to notify all users.
- Add a mini calender to show future events if any.
