    <h2>CS50 Final Project</h2>
    <br>
    <p> 
        This is a blogging website build using Django, HTML (with Bootstrap 4), CSS and some JavaScript and jQuery.
        The functionality of this website are:
        <ul>
            <li> Allow registered users to create a new blog post. Like/dislike blog post and leave comments. </li>
            <li> Allow users to customise their profile. Choose and crop their desired profile image. Toggle between Light and Dark Mode. </li>
            <li> Number of blog posts and comments per page are paginated to reduce clutter and improve loading time. </li>
            <li> Blog Posts, comments, likes/dislikes and profile settings are saved to the database. </li>
            <li> To save space in the server, old profile picture are deleted automatically when the users uploads a new profile picture.</li>
            <li> Authors of the blog post/comments are able to update/delete their post/comments if desired. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            Currently, the profile images are stored in AWS S3 Buckets and the website is deployed using Heroku.

        Future Improvements for the project can be implemented on the CS50 Sidebar:
        <ul>
            <li>Showing the latest post since we have tracked the date/time the post is created on the database.</li>
            <li>Showing trending post based on likes/dislike ratio of each post.</li>
            <li>Add some announcements if the website has some important updates (such as T&C) to notify all users.</li>
            <li>Add a mini calender to show future events if any.</li>
        </ul>
